    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the
      order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes
      squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell,
      the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy. Cuttlefish have
      large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with
      denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey. They generally
      range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the
      giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length
      and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]

      Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and
      other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals,
      seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
      cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to
      be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one
      of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

      The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the
      species, cudele, which may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion)
      and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the
      cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases
      from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and
      Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and
      temperate ocean waters. They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
      they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[11] They have an
      unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East
      and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all
      coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.
      By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North
      Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water
      species to cross.[12] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found
      in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may
      occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths,
      between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about
      180 m (600 ft).[13] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category
      of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means
      that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in
      some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic
      range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean acidification,
      however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into
      the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[14]

    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The
      organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally
      differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[15] Superficial
      similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be
      examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly
      curving W-shape.[16][17] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[18] they
      can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of
      contrast.

    <h3>Ink</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Like other marine mollusks, cuttlefish have ink stores that are used for
      chemical deterrence, phagomimicry, sensory distraction, and evasion when
      attacked.[25] Its composition results in a dark colored ink, rich in
      ammonium salts and amino acids that may have a role in phagomimicry
      defenses.[25] The ink can be ejected to create a "smoke screen" to hide
      the cuttlefish's escape, or it can be released as a pseudomorph of similar
      size to the cuttlefish, acting as a decoy while the cuttlefish swims
      away.[26]
